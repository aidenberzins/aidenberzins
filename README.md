      Aiden is a talented and dedicated full-stack engineer. In the time we worked together, Aiden led the development effort for a green-field product from the design phase through public release. He is an excellent problem solver and collaborator who would be a valuable asset to any software engineering team. <br/><br/><strong>Perhaps of even more value are the cultural contributions Aiden makes to a company.</strong> He works tirelessly to produce training and onboarding material, assist new hires, and plan team-building activities. He also helped to plan and host company-wide talks by speakers promoting awareness and acceptance of neurodivergent employees. Any company Aiden works with is made better by these efforts.
